üéØ WHAT IS PRECISION@10?
For each user:
1. We give them 10 book recommendations  
2. We check: how many of these 10 books did the user actually rate 4-5 stars?
3. Precision = (Number of 4-5 star books) / 10

üìä EXAMPLE CALCULATION:
User gets 10 recommendations: [Book A, Book B, Book C, ...]
User's actual ratings: Book A=5‚òÖ, Book C=4‚òÖ, others unknown/low
Hits = 2 books (Book A + Book C)
Precision@10 = 2/10 = 20%

üé≤ WHY 20% IS RANDOM BASELINE:
- 69% of all ratings in our data are 4-5 stars
- But users rate ONLY books they're likely to enjoy
- For random recommendations, much lower success rate
- Random baseline ‚âà 20% (estimated for blind recommendations)

üí° WHY 28% IS GOOD:
- 28% > 20% = 40% improvement over random!
- In absolute terms: users will like ~3 books out of every 10 recommended
- For a system with NO personalization, that's actually decent
- Real streaming services aim for 30-50% precision
