**Time Investment**: 2-3 days  
**Technical Complexity**: Low  
**Cost**: $0

#### 1.1 Local LLM Setup with Ollama
**Goal**: Run free, local LLMs on Mac M1 for basic text processing

```bash
# Install Ollama (Mac M1 optimized)
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh

# Pull recommended models for Mac M1
ollama pull llama3.2:3b          # 3B model - fast, good quality
