# Data Understanding & Analysis Specification
## Book Recommendation System Project

### 📋 Project Overview
**Objective**: Build a book recommendation system based on user reading patterns
**Dataset**: goodbooks-10k (10K books, 6M+ ratings, 53K+ users)

---

## 🎯 Core Analysis Tasks

### 1. Data Quality & Structure (2-3 days) ✅ COMPLETED
- [✅] Load and validate all CSV files
- [✅] Check for missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies
- [✅] Verify data types and relationships between files
- [✅] Document basic statistics (rows, columns, memory usage)

### 2. User Behavior Analysis (1-2 days) ✅ COMPLETED
- [✅] Rating distribution per user
- [✅] User activity levels (power users vs casual)
- [✅] Reading preferences patterns
**Key Visualizations**: ✅ ALL COMPLETED
- User rating distribution histogram
- User activity level pie chart
- Top 10 most active users bar chart

### 3. Book & Content Analysis (1-2 days) ❌ NOT STARTED
- [ ] Popular books and authors
- [ ] Genre/tag distribution
- [ ] Rating patterns across genres
**Key Visualizations**:
- Top 10 genres bar chart
- Average ratings by genre boxplot
- Most popular books scatter plot (ratings count vs average rating)

### 4. Recommendation System Specific (1-2 days) 🟡 PARTIALLY COMPLETED
- [✅] User-item interaction sparsity
- [✅] Cold start assessment
- [✅] Rating bias analysis
- [✅] Detailed user/item quantity analysis
- [✅] User interaction level distribution (low/high engagement)
**Key Visualizations**: 🟡 PARTIALLY COMPLETED
- [✅] Rating matrix sparsity heatmap
- [✅] Rating distribution histogram
- [ ] Cold start users/items bar chart
- [✅] User interaction level distribution plot

### 5. Advanced Analysis (2-3 days) ❌ NOT STARTED
- [ ] Feature Documentation
  - Create comprehensive CSV with feature explanations
  - Document important statistics for each feature
  - Add simple business meaning for each variable
- [ ] Correlation Analysis
  - Generate correlation matrix for numerical features
  - Create correlation heatmap
  - Identify significant feature relationships
- [ ] Data Cleaning Requirements
  - Document required encoding changes
  - List features needing standardization
  - Identify text fields requiring preprocessing
**Key Visualizations**:
- Correlation heatmap
- Feature statistics summary plots
- Data quality issues distribution chart
