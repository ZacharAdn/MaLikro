# Project Tracking - Book Recommendation System

## 🎯 Project Objective
Develop a personalized book recommendation system based on user ratings, focusing on:
- Recommendation accuracy (Precision@10 metric)
- Reasonable response time
- Ability to handle both new and existing users

## 📊 Performance Goals
### Final Targets:
- **Cold Start Precision@10**: 35-40% (new users)
- **Warm Start Precision@10**: 15-20% (existing users)
- Response time: Less than 500ms per recommendation
- Catalog coverage: At least 60% of books

## 📈 Results Tracking

### Baseline - Popularity-Based Model (✓ COMPLETED)
**Date**: 27/7/25
- **Cold Start Performance** (New Users):
  - Precision@10: 28.2% ✅
  - Training time: <1s
  - Evaluation time: ~2min for 1000 users
  - Perfect for user onboarding
  - Validates popularity approach

- **Warm Start Performance** (Existing Users):
  - Precision@10: 6.6% ✅
  - Training time: <1s
  - Evaluation time: ~2min for 1000 users
  - More realistic scenario
  - Good foundation for personalization

- **Technical Details**:
  - Successfully processes all 6M ratings
  - Proper train/test methodology
  - No data leakage
  - Book overlap: 65.7% (warm start)

- **Advantages**:
  - Simple implementation
  - Fast execution (<1s training)
  - Dual evaluation framework
  - Clear performance benchmarks

- **Disadvantages**:
  - Limited personalization
  - Only recommends popular books
  - Low recommendation diversity
  - Cold/warm start performance gap

### Item-Based Collaborative Filtering
**Date**: 27/7/25 🔄 IN PROGRESS

   - Cold start for new users
   - Warm start for personalization
2. **Baseline Performance**: 
   - Strong cold start (28.2%)
   - Realistic warm start (6.6%)
3. **Item-CF Potential**: 
   - Initial results need tuning
   - Evaluate both scenarios
4. **System Design**:
   - Need both recommendation modes
   - Switch based on user history
