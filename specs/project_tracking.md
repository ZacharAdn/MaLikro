# Project Tracking - Book Recommendation System

## 🎯 Project Objective
Develop a personalized book recommendation system based on user ratings, focusing on:
- Recommendation accuracy (Precision@10 metric)
- Reasonable response time
- Ability to handle new users

## 📊 Performance Goals
### Final Targets:
- Precision@10: 80% or higher
- Response time: Less than 500ms per recommendation
- Catalog coverage: At least 60% of books

## 📈 Results Tracking

### Baseline - Popularity-Based Model
**Date**: 10/6/25 ✅ COMPLETED
- **Performance**:
  - Precision@10: 11.8% (118/1000)
  - Catalog coverage: 0.3% (27 unique books)
  - Response time: <50ms (instant recommendations)
  - Users evaluated: 500 test users
- **Advantages**:
  - Simple implementation
  - Extremely fast execution
  - Consistent recommendations
  - Good foundation for comparison
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Very low personalization (same 27 books for everyone)
  - Low precision compared to expectations
  - Extremely limited coverage (only most popular books)
  - No diversity in recommendations

**Top Books Recommended**: Harry Potter series, Hunger Games, To Kill a Mockingbird

## 📋 Current Task List
1. [✅] Implement baseline (COMPLETED - 11.8% precision)
2. [✅] Analyze initial results (COMPLETED - see performance data above)
3. [✅] Book & content analysis (COMPLETED - see content insights below)
4. [✅] Identify improvement points (COMPLETED - need personalization & coverage)
5. [ ] Plan next phase - User-based collaborative filtering

## 📝 Notes & Observations
- **Baseline Reality Check**: 11.8% precision is actually reasonable for a non-personalized system
- **Coverage Problem**: Only 0.3% coverage means we're only recommending 27 books to everyone
- **Next Priority**: Implement user-based recommendations to improve personalization
- **Improvement Target**: Aim for >20% precision (75% improvement) in Phase 2
- Each phase should show at least 5% improvement in performance metrics
- Document all significant model changes
- Maintain balance between accuracy and execution time

## 🎯 Key Insights from Baseline
1. **Popular books work**: Harry Potter and Hunger Games are indeed widely liked
2. **Personalization gap**: Same recommendations for all users is major limitation
3. **Coverage gap**: 99.7% of books never get recommended
4. **Speed advantage**: <50ms response time is excellent foundation
